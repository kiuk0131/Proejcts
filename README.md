Unlocking Customer Insights for Customer-Centric Aircraft Design and Value Engineering through Feedback Analysis

The automotive industry has been incorporating numerous new features into their vehicles based on valuable customer feedback. This progress has been made possible through direct interaction and engagement with customers. However, in the aviation industry, there exists a gap between the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the final users, the passengers, primarily due to the existing business model.

In order to address this gap and drive improvement, we aim to bridge the divide and explore opportunities for value engineering within the aviation industry. Through this exercise, we seek to leverage customer-centric feedback and apply it to the aviation industry, much like how the automotive industry has successfully done. By gathering and analyzing passenger feedback, we can identify opportunities for innovation, refine existing processes, and develop solutions that address their specific needs.

The method that we will use in this analysis is Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is the branch of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. NLP combines linguistic and computer science to analyze and understand the underlying grammatical and systematic rules of language. The steps of NLP involve the following:

* Segmentation: Breaking the entire document down into constituent sentences. 
* Tokenizing: Breaking each sentence into its constituent words and storing them. 
* Stopwords: Removing commonly used words that do not carry significant meaning, such as articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. 
* Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form by removing suffixes and prefixes. For example, "running" becomes "run." Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, but instead of truncating words, lemmatization converts words to their base form using vocabulary and morphological analysis. For example, "running" becomes "run" and "better" becomes "good." Speed Tagging: Assigning part-of-speech tags to each word in a sentence based on its grammatical role, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This process involves using algorithms or models to automatically assign these tags based on contextual and linguistic features. 
  
  
In this project, we will explreorr both classical NLP and Deep learning based NLP. We will compare the accuracy of models. We will use dataset from Process Twitter API - Aspect-based sentiment analysis. First we will exptere the data through Exploratory Data Analysis
